# Exchange

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`


## HOW TO USE
# Self tests are run via `mix test`
# start your server with `mix phx.server`
# In the browser the major endpoint is `localhost:4000/rates`
# Use `/latest` to get the latest rates
# Use `/YYYY-MM-DD` to get the selected data on that date
# Use `/analyze` to get the analyzed data
# Note: The list is in descending order as time constraints prevent me from reordering and structuring the JSON encoding.
